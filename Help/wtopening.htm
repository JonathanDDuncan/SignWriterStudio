<h1><span lang="es">Opening SignWriter Studio™ File Walkthrough</span></h1>
<p>To Open a new empty SignWriter Studio<span lang="es">™ file</span> (.SWS) which 
    holds the Dicitionary and the SignList.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click on File/Open SignWriter Studio<span lang="es">™ </span>File (or Ctrl-O).
        </li>
        <li>An Open dialog box will appear prompting you to choose the folder and the name 
            of the file.&nbsp; Click Open to choose the file.</li>
        <li>A message box will appear indicating the signlanguages and gloss languages in 
            the file.&nbsp; </li>
        <li>Set your Options in File/Options that match the signs in the file.</li>
        <li>The filename will appear at the top of the window of the Dictionary window.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;You can now use the Dictionary and SignLists menus from the Module menu.
        </li>
    </ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<p>You can have several SignWriter Studio™ files on your 
    computer. Most people will only ever use one.&nbsp; You can only open one file 
    at a time. (However you can open SignWriter Studio™ twice 
    and have each working in a different file.)</p>
    <p>The Document menu is always available no matter whether or not you opened a 
        SignWriting Studio™ File. </p>
    <p>The next time you open SignWriter Studio™ the last SignWriter Studio™ File will 
        open.&nbsp; This is so that you don&#39;t have to choose the file each time you 
        start if you only use one file.</p>
