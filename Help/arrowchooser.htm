<h1>Arrow Chooser™</h1>
<p><span lang="es">The Arrow Chooser™ helps choose the oritentation of arrows.&nbsp; 
    </span></p>
    <p><span lang="es">The chooser distinguishes between several types of arrows 
        depending on the type of arrow chosen.&nbsp; Here are the possibilities: &quot;Right 
        Hand, Left Hand, Superposed Hands, Right Hand Flipped, Left Hand Flipped, 
        Superposed HandsFlipped, No Arrowhead&quot;.</span></p>
    <p><span lang="es">The symbol in the top right hand corner is the currently selected 
        symbol.</span></p>
    <p>
        <img class="style1" src="images/arrowchooser.PNG" /></p>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<p><span lang="es">All of the settings can be selected using the keyboard.</span></p>
    <p><span lang="es">You can switch from the wall plane to the floor plane and back 
        using number 5 key. The top circle of rotations is for the wall plane and the 
        lower circle of rotations is for the floor plane.</span></p>
    <p><span lang="es">The numbers of the hand rotations selections are the 8 outside 
        numeric keys of the numeric keyboard.&nbsp; Each of the 8 pointing away from the 
        center.</span></p>
    <p><span lang="es">Being the case that an arrow does not have a corresponding arrow 
        in the other plane other circle of rotations does not show.</span></p>
    <p><span lang="es">If a group of arrows isn&#39;t in the wall plane or the floor plane, 
        the picture of the arrows in the plane will not display.&nbsp; The controls will 
        provide an approximate orientation for the arrows.</span></p>
    <p><span lang="es">The flip checkbox is to flip certain arrows.&nbsp; Click on the 
        checkbox or press the &#39;-&#39; to flip an arrow.</span></p>
