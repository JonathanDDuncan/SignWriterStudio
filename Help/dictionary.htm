<h1>Dictionary</h1>
<p><span lang="es">The Dictionary is a listing of searchable signs.&nbsp; It can be 
    searched in any two written languages and one sign language without changing the 
    dictionary settings.&nbsp; The gloss languages and the sign language depends on 
    the options selected.&nbsp; The same dictionary file can hold as many gloss 
    languages and sign languages as desired.&nbsp; You can also have as many 
    dictionary files as you wish.&nbsp; Is is expected that most people only use one 
    dictionary file.</span></p>

        Window Explorer.&nbsp; It will open it in SignWriter Studio™. You will need to

        only one gloss language is available.&nbsp; The dictionary can save glosses in 
        an indefinite number of languages for any one sign but can only display two at a 
        time.&nbsp; </span></p>

        with a line at the end move to the beginning and end of the grid.&nbsp; The
